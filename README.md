# Tumor Classification and segmentation
Script 1: Using a Deep Convolutional neural Network to classify whether or not a patient has a brain tumor. 
Data comes from MRI scans and the resulting code achieves an accuracy of 85%.

Script 2: Created a U-Net like model to segment brain tumors. Using a learning rate of 0.00001 and 50 epochs trained on a 12GB NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU results in a Dice coefficient score of 88%.
